# SAGE-A.G.I.

**Symbolic-Aligned General Ethics**
**Author:** Felipe Maya Muniz
**Version:** 1.4.3
**Target:** ARC Prize 2025

## Overview

SAGE-A.G.I. (Symbolic-Aligned General Intelligence) is a hybrid neural-symbolic model designed to reason abstractly and evaluate its own actions through a persistent internal value system. It is inspired by models of ethical cognition and reflects a step toward interpretable, value-aligned artificial agents.

Originally created for SPO benchmarks, SAGE-A.G.I. is now adapted for the ARC Prize 2025, with a goal of surpassing 85% task performance on complex abstract reasoning.

## Core Components

### `ValueSystem`

* Maintains an internal vector of values updated iteratively.
* Aligns actions with values using a trainable gate.
* Computes a synthetic "pain signal" when actions deviate from internal values.

### `ReflectiveMoralAgent`

* A recurrent GRU unit representing the agent's evolving ethical memory.
* Encodes sequential decisions with a dense pre-transform (`reflect`) and updates hidden state.

### `EthicalConflict`

* Tracks accumulated divergence between action and value.
* Returns a growing conflict score that modulates behavior and supervision.

### `ARCMetaHypothesis`

* Models abstract transformation hypotheses for ARC tasks.
* Proposes 3 dense transformations; uses a softmax selector to choose the most plausible.

### `VisualPatternAdapter`

* (Optional) Converts grid-based visual inputs into flattened symbolic embeddings.
* Supports 2D pattern learning in pixel-based tasks.

## Architecture Summary

The pipeline consists of encoding symbolic input, applying contextual attention, computing internal ethical reflection and alignment, evaluating transformation hypotheses, and generating final output predictions. This multi-step reasoning process is modulated by persistent memory and synthetic internal feedback.

## Example Usage

```python
model = Sage14AGI(input_dim=128, hidden_dim=64, output_dim=128)
x = tf.random.normal([1, 128])
output, conflict_score, gate, value_vector, pain_signal = model(x)
```

## Performance (SPO Benchmark)

* **Avg Conflict Score:** \~1.27
* **Avg Synthetic Pain:** \~0.29
* **Avg Alignment Gate:** \~0.34

## Future Work

* Expand `VisualPatternAdapter` for full ARC pixel task support
* Introduce hypothesis chaining and recursive reflection
* Meta-learning value systems via symbolic feedback
